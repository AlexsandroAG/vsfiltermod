 # Tags \fax, \fay now works as they should. Allowed multiple instances in one line.
 # Negative fontspacing now works from style definition.
 # VSFilterMod correctly loads attached data if its first symbol in UUE code is "[".
 # Moveable \org:
  * \org(x1,y1);
  * \org(x1,y1,x2,y2`[`,t1,t2`]`) â€”  moves origin point from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) in interval (t1,t2). Similar to \move parameters.
